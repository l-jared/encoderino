First episode of the live action Sukeban Deka TV series, with styled softsubs
Had this lying around for a while, decided to work on it again
I had reached out to SkewedS for the original softsubs but they lost them in a hard drive failure

Trimmed black screen at beginning and end
Audio losslessly cut with acsuite
Translation is taroroot@D-Addicts's with SkewedS edits + some of my own minor edits
Dialogue styling to match Skewed Studios
Medium effort typesetting
Redone timing

This source has a slight green tint, I don't know how to deal with it so I left it
Lazy edgefixing, it's not good-tier but still better than all encodes out there
Deblock, deband, dehalo (still some halos left)

Thanks to Jinsol for ripping from Amazon
Thanks to mutsuto for the title typesetting
Thanks to friend and Motxi for some sign translations
