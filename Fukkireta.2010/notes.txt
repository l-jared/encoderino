mpv is highly recommended for playing this release.
It relies on possibly unintended behavior of external and internal subtitles with ordered chapters.
VLC handles it the same way as mpv, but subtitles randomly flicker or entire lines disappear.
Haven't tried MPC-HC.

This release features YouTube community annotations, converted to ASS using my own renderer https://github.com/po5/assnotations
Annotations should be on by default, assuming your player autoloads -and prefers- external subtitles.

I've opted to not anti-alias any of the original drawings.
Colors got fucked somewhere in the process, I chose to reproduce that mistake to match the popular video.

Some frames in the initial line drawings were shifted 1px up, this error trickled down to the colored version where the mouth is shifted 1px up.
These errors were fixed.

This is 75 FPS not only for the memes but because Teto and Hattoushin don't have the same number of frames of animation, this is required for accurate timing.

English, Japanese and Chinese danmaku comments for sm10780722 are included, converted to ASS with https://github.com/m13253/danmaku2ass

Notes for mpv:
--autoload-files=yes --sub-auto=fuzzy if annotations don't display.
--sid=1 to disable annotations.
--edition=1 for the regular version.
--vf=format:colormatrix=bt.601 for original, unfucked colors.

Bread background:
Extracted the best looking frames, masked out Teto & Hattoushin, aligned and averaged them together, then upscaled and further cleaned it up.
Original files were never provided, so this is the best I could do.
Positioning and movement matches the original video, background is shifted 0.285px horizontally and 0.185px vertically every frame for 1024x768 @ 30FPS, divided by 2.5 for 75FPS.

Audio:
Lon - Original audio from sm10780722
UTAU - Lossless audio cut & synced from EXIT TUNES PRESENTS Vocaloanthems feat. Hatsune Miku album
Instrumental - From sm10673673
NES - ftm exported to WAV with FamiTracker, transcoded to Opus

Lipsync recreation:
Removed duplicate frames in the reference video and wrote a script to match mouth shapes.
Each mouth movement was then manually checked and corrected where the script messed up.

Annotation renderer:
Used annotationlib's algorithm for speech bubble arrows, it's different from the way YouTube does it and messed up some of the annotation art.
Each speech bubble's arrows were manually adjusted to match original YouTube rendering.
Text wrapping is mostly offloaded to libass through clever use of margins.
The only text processing was to split words too long to fit on a line by themselves, and some trickery to preserve leading spaces.

Subtitles:
tripflag was kind enough to re-upload his original ASS subs, but they were made for VSFilter and looked all wonky with libass https://github.com/libass/libass/issues/465
The original ass file (with minor edits to add explicit newlines) and the script used to make subs work in libass can be found on my Github https://gist.github.com/po5/b80f575b4620d4650c3fd9a596eb7ef2
